# Flappy-McFlapFace

My first game built on Unity - a clone of Flappy Bird.

Initial build was from following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM).

Extensions to tutorials include:
- Adding clouds in the background, that do not collide and spawn at random sizes and speeds to create an illusion of depth to the graphics
- Increasing the spawn rate of the pipes for every multiple of 5 the score reaches, to ramp up the difficult the further you go
- Keeping track of the highest score achieved to give you a target to beat
- Adding sounds effects for passing a pipe, the increase after every 5 score and game over
- Adding a start screen so you can start when you are ready rather than going straight into it
- Adding a settings page that allows you to turn off the sound effects
